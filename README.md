# Fraud-Detection-SKLearn
Classification through various models for fraud analysis found in international calls.<br>
The idea of the project is to reverse engineer fraud rules used in industry by looking at
the data and using a K means algorithm to determine what the original fraud rules were,
and which Call Data Records (CDRs) belong to which fraud rule.<br>
